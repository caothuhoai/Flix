### Notes
The challenge I have encountered with this project was to import the AlamofireImage Pod. My guess is that the tutorial video was made a few years ago, so the Xcode interface has changed since. Not only the pod but sometimes also the features in Xcode were different from what's shown in the video. However, I'm glad that I was able to figure it out in a relatively short amount of time.
